Dom C Portfolio Privacy Policy

The Dom C Portfolio App logs each session locally to your device. In addition, each time you click submit, the label that you made is sent over Bluetooth LE to a local server if one is running.

The app does not send any information to the app developers.

If we inadvertantly end up with any personal information of yours our policy is to delete it as soon as it is discovered.
